# FICO Xpress Bindings for Concorde

This project is my way of learning Xpress while working on something challenging.

## Current State

Right now, only partially working bindings are available in `lpxpress94.c`. I based them on the CPLEX and QsOpt bindings from the original project. They work to some extent, but more advanced operations from the CPLEX bindings haven't been ported yet.
